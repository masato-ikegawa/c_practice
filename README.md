# c_practice

# overview
  This is my c practice through some Numerical analysis.
  I tried to implement them in very simple case.
  Here is a list of it
  - Gaussian elimination
  - Gauss-Jordan method
  - Symplex method
  - Symplex method(2 stages)
  - Newton method
  
  I will continue this challenge and enjoy learning c.
